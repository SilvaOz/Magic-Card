## Description

Magic Mind Reader  is a fun game where you are presented with 10 cards and you have to choose a number between 1 and 100. You keep this number in your head or write it down, and when you are asked if your card is present, you say yes or no based on the cards that are shown to you. After all 10 cards have been shown, you press "guess" to reveal the number you chose. You can use this game to show off your magic skills to your friends, whether on your mobile device or however else you choose to play it.
